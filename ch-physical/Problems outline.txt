1 Signals in the Physical World 1
	1.1 Multimedia and Sensation 
	1.2 Sensation and Perception 
		Has important terms section
	1.3 Computer Video Displays 
		one example (CRT)
	1.4 Multimedia System Operation 
		A1 and A2 questions embedded in paragraph
		Both deal with bit rate:
			All of these place a high demand on computer power. For example, let's assume that
			we encode audio information as 8 bits per sample at 8000 samples per second (this would
			be considered very low quality). How many bits per second is that (answer in A.1 #1)?
			Perhaps that doesn't sound too bad, so let's consider video. Let's say we encode each frame
			in a video stream as 1000x1000 pixels, 24 bits/pixel, and 30 frames/second. How many
			bits per second is that (answer in A.1 #2)? Even if we were to achieve an extremely high
			compression ratio of 1/500, this would still mean more than 1 million bits/second.
	1.5 Vibrations and Sound 
		Embedded Q: 
		So, we need to find a function, x(t), whose second derivative is proportional to itself. Can
		you think of one or two (answer in A.1 #3)?
		If the two forks were close together, we would heard the sum of their tones. What would that sum be (answer in A.1 #6)?
	1.6 Phasors 
		What does u + v look like if u and v are rotating at the same rate (answer in A.1 #7)?
		Review Exercises: Complex Numbers
			1. What is the sum of the two complex numbers x + jy and v + jw (answer in A.1 #8)?
			2. What is the product of the two complex numbers x + jy and v + jw (answer in A.1 #9)?
			3. Convert the complex number z = x + jy to polar form, R6  (answer in A.1 #10).
			4. Multiply the two polar-form complex numbers R16 1 and R26 2 (answer in A.1 #11).
		Self-Test Exercises
			1. Multiply the two complex sinusoids z1 and z2 (answer in A.1 #12).
			2. The complex conjugate is indicated by z. If z = x+jy, z = x??jy. What is the complex
			conjugate of the complex sinusoid, z = Rej (answer in A.1 #13)?
			3. Answer the following for z = x + jy (answers in A.1 #14):
				(a) What is z + z?
				(b) What is z ?? z?
				(c) What is zz?
	1.7 Spectra 
		1.7.1 Interlude: Vectors 
		1.7.2 Derivation of the Fourier Series 
			Self-Test Exercises
				See A.1 #15-16 for answers.
				1. Prove the relationship in (1-43).
				2. From equation (1-45), derive (1-46). Hint: Use the fact that equation (1-45) is a real signal to simplify the complex multiplication.
			Self-Test Exercise
				See A.1 #17 for the answer.
				1. Prove (1-58).
	1.8 Problems 
		1. Discuss how does fork mass affects tuning fork vibration frequency.
		2. What musical instruments might be governed by properties analogous to that of a
		tuning fork?
		3. When you add two sinusoids with frequencies that differ by delta, the result is beating.
		Imagine you're tuning a guitar. As the two strings get closer together in tone, what
		happens to the beat frequency? Show how this result is predicted by the sum of the
		complex sinusoids.
		4. Implement a "Complex" class for an object oriented programming language (i.e., Java, C++/#, python) representing complex numbers. Your class should include at least the following methods:
			 add()
			 multiply()
			 real()
			 imag()
			 magnitude()
			 angle()
		Document your code so that this class could be used by someone else. Write a test
		program that exercises all of this class' methods. Submit hard copy of your code, your
		test program output, and your documentation.
		5. Derive equation (1-54) from equation (1-53). (Simplifying sum of complex exponentials)
		6. Determine the coeffcients of the Fourier series for the signal
		x(t) = cos pi/3 t
		
	Major testable concepts:
	1. Vib And Sound: Periodicity occurs in nature and is governed by differential equations
		(prob 1 adresses) 
		*This concept is complete but questions are tied to the physics, needs some restructuring
			The differential equation for a tuning fork is -k/m sin(omega t), where m= the mass of the tuning fork. As the tuning fork gets heavier, what happens to vibration frequency?
	2. Vib and Sound: Sinusoidal phase through tuning forks. 
		(prob 2 addresses and is complete and open ended)
	3. Phasors: A rotating vector in the complex plane. 
		(prob 3 addresses beating as notes get closer together)
		*Needs additional problem on combining multiple sinusoids, use lab 1 for more
	4. Phasors: Sinusoids are actually exponentials (Euler) 
		(no problems except self test)
		*Needs some additional problems with a little more paper and pencil work, use lab 1 for more problems
			Use problems step 2.2 #1,2,4,5,6
			Use problems step 2.3 #1-2
			Use problem 3.2 (f) 
	5. Phasors: Frequency and period 
		(no problems)
		*Need one or two problems on calculating the period of a sum of complex exponentials.
			What is the period of exp(-j pi/4 t) + exp(-j pi/2 t)?
			What is the period of exp(-j T_0 t) + exp(-j 5T_0 t)?
	6. Spectra: Harmonics can represent any signal 
		(no problems)
		These problems get tough and are taken care of by the Fourier Series questions
	7. Spectra Vectors: adding, subtracting, dot product in the plane 
		(covered in self test)
		No additional problems needed
	8. Spectra Fourier series: How to derive the coefficients from a harmonic waveform 
		(prob 5 and 6, very simple)
		Clarify to calculate the C_k complex coefficients here.
		*Need a couple more one medium and one hard
			Medium: recitified sine wave
			Hard: Sawtooth derivation
