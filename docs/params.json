As a result,\r\ncomputers become embedded in the physical world, with their primary\r\npurpose being to detect and analyze happenings in our world and to\r\nproduce responses that affect that world. As computing professionals,\r\nwe need to understand how computers can process information from the\r\nphysical world as digital signals: multimedia (sound, images, video)\r\nand other measurements (in medical instruments, cars, cell phones,\r\neyeglasses, etc). This is \"Signal Computing\", which places great\r\ndemands on processing power, network bandwidth, storage capacity, I/O\r\nspeed, and software design. As a result, it is a great laboratory for\r\nexercising the full range of knowledge of computer science.\r\n\r\nWhile there certainly may be many opportunities for students to\r\neventually work in signal computing, the value of their study of this\r\ntopic extends far beyond. Studying signal computing and its underlying\r\nmathematics directly exercises key computer science abilities in areas\r\nlike abstraction and algorithmics. As this book progresses, we take\r\na familiar representation of digital signals or operations, reach a\r\nconcept in which it is awkward or difficult to use, and then develop\r\nan alternative representation that simplifies matters. This is exactly\r\nwhat computing professionals do in their careers -- identify that a\r\nproblem at hand can be represented by some abstraction with known\r\nproperties that can be manipulated by well-understood algorithms.\r\n\r\nYou can find the main web site for this project at\r\nhttp://faculty.washington.edu/stiber/pubs/Signal-Computing/.\r\n\r\nThis work is licensed under a\r\n[Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.](creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
