			1. Aliasing can happen in the world around you. Identify the source of the original signal and 
			the sampling mechanism in the following situations: 
			(a) The hubcap of a car coming to a stop in a motion picture; 
			(b) A TV news anchor squirming while wearing a tweed jacket; 
			(c) A helicopter blade while the helicopter is starting up on a sunny day. 
2.4 Quantization
	LSB as a means of gathering statistics of error in ADC
			In this case, µ = 0 and the variable’s range is [-1/2, +1/2]. The result is a standard 
			deviation of σ = 1/√12 LSB 
			≈ 0.29 LSB (how [answer in A.2 #4]?).

2.7 Old Problems 
	These are primarily MATLAB housekeeping problems. Although, I really like the aliasing problems.
		1. The analytical formula for synthesis of a 50% duty cycle square wave as a sum of 
		harmonically related sine waves (its Fourier series) is: 
		x(t) = 4 
		π 􏰇sin(ω0 t) + 
		1 
		3 sin(3ω0 t) + 
		1 
		5 sin(5ω0 t) + · · · 􏰈 
		Write a MATLAB program to compute and plot the spectrum of a square wave given 
		this equation. Your program should prompt the user for ω0 and which harmonic is 
		the maximum to plot. Note that you are not being asked to plot the square wave 
		as a function of time; you should plot the amplitudes of the component sinusoids as 
		a function of the sinusoids’ frequencies (like ﬁgure 1.12). Hand in hard copy of your 
		MATLAB code and a plot of the spectrum with 10 harmonics. You may ﬁnd the 
		MATLAB function stem() useful. 
		
		2. Modify your above program to show how these harmonics are aliased if the square 
		wave is sampled at ωs (prompting the user for ωs ). Hand in hard copy of your code 
		and an example plot for ωs < ω0 . 		
		
		3. Modify your program to play the sound of the aliased square wave (synthesize x(t) from 
		problem 2). Next, write a program to generate a band-limited square wave from a sum 
		of sinusoids, given ω0 and ωs , with no frequency components above the Nyquist limit. 
		Play that sound (the MATLAB function soundsc() is useful for this). Compare the 
		sounds with and without (from problem 1, given that ωs determines ωmax ) aliasing. 
		Can you ﬁnd an interesting use for intentional aliasing? Hand in your code’s hard 
		copy, plots of the sample square wave and the band limited square wave (as functions 
		of time ), and your written comments. 

	
		
	Major testable concepts:
		RMS, need two problems
			1. What is the RMS magnitude of the sine wave A*sin(wt)?
			answer: A/sqrt(2)
			2. What is the RMS magnitude of the sawtooth waveform 
			x(t) = A/T * t, 0<t<=T
			And x(t) repeats every T seconds
			answer: A/sqrt(3)
			
		SNR, need two problems built off RMS from previous 
			3. The sin wave from problem 1 is sampled in noise, 
			if the desired SNR is 20 dB, how large can the RMS magnitude of the noise be?
			answer: 20 = 20 log(A/(sqrt(2) Nrms)), Nrms=A/(sqrt(2)*exp(1))
			4. If the sawtooth waveform from problem 2 is considered noise and
			the sine wave from problem 1 is the signal, what is the SNR in dB?
			answer: 10 log(sqrt(3/2))=5 log(3/2)=0.9dB
			
		Aliasing, two or three problems
			5. The signal exp(j 2pi 200 t) is sampled at ws=2pi*300. 
			What are the actual, digital, and apparent frequencies?
			answer: 2pi*200rad/s, -2/3 pi rad/sample, -100 *2pi rad/s
			6. The signal cos( 2pi 200 t) is sampled at ws=2pi*250.
			What are the actual, digital and apparent frequencies of the resulting cosines?
			answer: 2pi*200rad/s, 2/5 pi rad/sample, 50 *2pi rad/s
			7. The fourier series of a square wave is given by XXX. 
			(a) What is the RMS magnitude?
			(b) If we consider the band limit of the square wave to be when it has no other frequencies with magnitudes larger than 1% of the RMS magnitude, then what is the minimum sampling rate to capture all frequencies below the band limit without aliasing?
			
		Quantization, 2 problems
			8. Suppose we wish to sample from an audio signal that ranges from 0 to 2.5V (Assume that the range of our ADC is 0-2.5V also). If the analog noise on the line is 3mV and our ADC is 8bits, what percentage of the total SNR is from the analog noise and what percentage is from the 8 bit quantization?
			9. If we have the same signal from question 8 (audio signal from 0-2.5V with 3mV analog noise), 
			(a) how many bits should our ADC have so that the noise added by quantization is less than the analog noise?
			(b) how many bits should our ADC have so that the quantization noise does not decrease our SNR by more than 1%?
